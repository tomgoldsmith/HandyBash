## Folder Clean Up

This script finds files that are older than a the number of days defined in the options and moves them to a /old directory. Once they have been untouched in that folder for the number of days defined in the options they are deleted.

Handy to use with a cronjob on a downloads folder to prevent it being clogged with useless files.
